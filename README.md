# TTY_SERVER
<!-- code for new client is remaining that is to broadcast it about to all other clients and also to add in the database with new sequence number and to manage the type+payload that is requried to be sent is remaining -->
session will start with 1 sequence number


I have to properly handle the chunks because my result that needs to be sent to all clients will be large so it needs to sent in chunks and it should look like a terminal coutput at the client sides

code for synchronizing the info about current client is remaining

code for generating url for session at start of session is remaining and sending that url to terminal the session is remaining

code for adding redis remaining

code for removing client is remaining
 
code for closing session , clients for that session and closeing all goroutines associted with that thread is remaining and cleaning or erasing memory

code for connecting with  terminal server , clients frontend , and this TTY_Server is remaining

so i am able to connect terminal, client frontend, tty server locally now i have to open 3,4 clients on browser

sudo command is not working so i have to handle that thing
